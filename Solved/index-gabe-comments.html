<!-- Detailed Breakdown:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`:
   - Declares the document type as HTML5, ensuring the browser parses the document in standards-compliant mode.

2. `<meta charset="UTF-8">`:
   - Defines the character encoding for the HTML document as UTF-8, ensuring that it can display a wide variety of characters and symbols.

3. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`:
   - Configures the viewport to make the page responsive by adjusting the layout based on the screen size and resolution of the device.

4. `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">`:
   - Ensures that the document is displayed in the latest browser rendering mode available.

5. `<title>Car Miles</title>`:
   - Sets the title of the web page, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

6. `<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>`:
   - Loads the latest version of Plotly.js, a graphing library used to create the bar chart for visualizing the car miles data.

7. `<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>`:
   - Loads the latest version of D3.js, which is used to load and process data from external sources (such as a JSON file).

8. `<div id="plot"></div>`:
   - This div acts as a container for the Plotly.js chart. The id "plot" is used by JavaScript to reference this element and render the bar chart.

9. `<script src="plots.js"></script>`:
   - Links to an external JavaScript file named `plots.js`, where the main logic for reading the data using D3.js and creating the Plotly.js chart is located.
